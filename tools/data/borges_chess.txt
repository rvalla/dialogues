King faint, bishop slanted, queen fierce, rook direct
queen, direct rook and ladino pawn
on the black and white of the road
they seek and fight their armed battle.
They do not know that the player's
of the player governs their destiny,
they do not know that an adamantine rigor
holds their will and their journey.
The gambler is also a prisoner
(the sentence is Omar's) of another chessboard
of black nights and white days.
God moves the player, and the player, the piece.
What God behind God the plot begins
of dust and time and sleep and agony?
