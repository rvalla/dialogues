# dialogues

### what is **dialogues**?

**dialogues** is a group of experiments in which I am trying to transform text to music. Initialy
I am simply using properties of text such as the number of words in a sentence, the number of symbols
in a word or the Levenshtein's distance between words. This is work in progress...  

## standing upon the shoulders of giants

This little project is possible thanks to a lot of work done by others in the *open-source* community. Particularly in
this case I need to mention:

- [**Python**](https://www.python.org/): one of the programming languages I used.  
- [**Wikipedia**](hhttps://www.wikipedia.org/): the place from I learn how to implement an algorithm to measure the
Levenshtein's distance.
